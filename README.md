<h1> Hi! I'm Mohammed Qahtani <br/><a 

<h2> </h2>
I'm a sophomore materials engineering student passionate about interdisciplinary problem-solving. With experience in data analysis and lab work, I'm interested in connecting engineering with project management. I'm always open to new experiences and learning opportunities.


<h2> Experiences:</h2>

- <b> The University of Illinois Urbana Champaign - Materials Advantage </b>

    - Regularly attended meetings and seminars designed to foster knowledge expansion and skills enhancement in the field of materials science and engineering.
    - Worked under the guidance of a senior club mentor to gain insights into advanced materials concepts, industry best practices, and career development strategies.
  
- <b> King Abdulaziz University - Student Researcher </b>

    - Spearheaded Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF) research under the guidance of Prof. Bassam Zafar, focusing on predicting electrical load patterns for residential settings.
    - Utilized Weka, a prominent data mining software, to accurately forecast the electrical load of a house multiple hours in advance, enhancing the prediction's reliability and utility.
    - Conducted a comprehensive comparison of various forecasting algorithms, including Linear Regression, Gaussian Processes, Sequential Minimal Optimization Regression (SMOreg), and Multilayer Perceptrons. This analysis aimed to identify the most effective method for time-series forecasting in the context of STLF
    - Culminated the research experience by presenting a detailed poster on the findings at the National Science and Engineering Fair in Saudi Arabia
 
- <b> Columbia University (Materials Science and Nanotechnology) - Summer Student </b>

    - Gained comprehensive knowledge in the field of materials science technology and engineering
    - Actively participated in daily seminars with experts from academic, industrial, and national laboratories, enhancing understanding of real-world applications.
    - Demonstrated proficiency in software like ChemDraw, mastering its use in drawing molecules, crystalline structures, and interpreting H-NMR spectra.
