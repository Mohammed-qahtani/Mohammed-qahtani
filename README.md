<h1> Hi! I'm Mohammed Qahtani <br/><a 

<h2> </h2>

I'm a sophomore materials science and engineering student passionate about interdisciplinary problem-solving. With experiences in data analysis and lab work, I'm interested in connecting the computational side of my skillset with materials engineering. More broadly, I am drawn to projects that bridge engineering and project management. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing volleyball, soccer, and reading.
I'm always open to new experiences and learning opportunities!

<h2> Experiences:</h2>

- <b> The University of Illinois Urbana Champaign - Materials Advantage </b>

    - Regularly attended meetings and seminars designed to foster knowledge expansion and skills enhancement in the field of materials science and engineering.
    - Worked under the guidance of a senior club mentor to gain insights into advanced materials concepts, industry best practices, and career development strategies.

  
- <b> King Abdulaziz University - Student Researcher </b>
   
    - ([Research Paper Link](https://github.com/Mohammed-qahtani/Mohammed-qahtani/blob/main/BADM261_Research.pdf))
    - Spearheaded Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF) research under the guidance of Prof. Bassam Zafar, focusing on predicting electrical load patterns for residential settings.
    - Utilized Weka, a prominent data mining software, to accurately forecast the electrical load of a house multiple hours in advance, enhancing the prediction's reliability and utility.
    - Conducted a comprehensive comparison of various forecasting algorithms, including Linear Regression, Gaussian Processes, Sequential Minimal Optimization Regression (SMOreg), and Multilayer Perceptrons. This analysis aimed to identify the most effective method for time-series forecasting in the context of STLF
    - Culminated the research experience by presenting a detailed poster on the findings at the National Science and Engineering Fair in Saudi Arabia
